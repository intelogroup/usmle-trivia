# 🔍 Authentication Backend Error Diagnosis Report

**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Issue:** `[CONVEX A(auth:signIn)] Server Error` preventing user authentication  
**Site:** https://usmle-trivia.netlify.app/  

## 🎯 Issue Summary

The authentication system is failing with a "Server Error" when users attempt to log in. The error appears as:
```
[CONVEX A(auth:signIn)] [Request ID: cc1e3134ddae549d] Server Error
Called by client
```

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - ✅ Site loads successfully (200 OK)
   - ✅ Login form renders correctly
   - ✅ Form submission triggers backend request
   - ✅ All JavaScript assets load properly

2. **Network Connectivity**
   - ✅ Convex backend is reachable (`https://formal-sardine-916.convex.cloud`)
   - ✅ CORS headers are properly configured
   - ✅ Basic deployment is running ("This Convex deployment is running")

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - ✅ `VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://formal-sardine-916.convex.cloud` is set
   - ✅ Environment variables are consistent across files
   - ✅ Convex Auth dependency installed (`@convex-dev/auth: ^0.0.88`)

### ❌ Failing Components

1. **Backend API Endpoints**
   - ❌ All API endpoints return 404 Not Found:
     - `/auth` → 404
     - `/api/auth` → 404
     - `/api` → 404
     - `/_convex/api` → 404

2. **Convex HTTP Router**
   - ❌ HTTP routes not responding to requests
   - ❌ Auth handlers not accessible

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - ❌ `auth:signIn` function throws server error
   - ❌ User cannot log in with valid credentials

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is that **Convex backend functions are not properly deployed or the HTTP router is misconfigured**. The symptoms indicate:

1. The Convex deployment exists but functions aren't accessible
2. HTTP routes defined in `convex/http.ts` are not working
3. The auth system can't process signin requests

## 💡 Recommended Solutions

### 🚀 Immediate Fix (High Priority)

1. **Redeploy Convex Backend Functions**
   ```bash
   # From the project directory
   npx convex deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Verify HTTP Router Configuration**
   - Check `convex/http.ts` exports the router correctly
   - Ensure `auth.addHttpRoutes(http)` is called
   - Verify Convex Auth is properly initialized

3. **Test Backend Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Test that functions are accessible
   curl https://formal-sardine-916.convex.cloud/api
   ```

### 🔍 Detailed Investigation Steps

1. **Check Convex Dashboard**
   - Verify functions are deployed in Convex dashboard
   - Check for any deployment errors
   - Confirm HTTP routes are configured

2. **Validate Auth Configuration**
   - Verify `convex/auth.ts` exports are correct
   - Check Password provider is properly configured
   - Ensure auth tables are defined in schema

3. **Test Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Run local Convex development
   npm run convex:dev
   
   # Test locally first
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🛠️ Technical Details

**Expected HTTP Endpoints:**
- `GET/POST /api` - Main Convex API endpoint
- Auth routes should be handled through the HTTP router

**Current Status:**
- Backend responds to root requests (200 OK)
- All specific API paths return 404
- Frontend correctly attempts to make requests

**Required Files:**
- ✅ `convex/http.ts` - HTTP router configuration
- ✅ `convex/auth.ts` - Auth provider setup
- ✅ `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema with auth tables

## 📊 Test Results Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Frontend Loading | ✅ Pass | Site loads, forms work |
| Backend Connectivity | ✅ Pass | Can reach Convex URL |
| CORS Configuration | ✅ Pass | Headers allow frontend |
| API Endpoints | ❌ Fail | All return 404 |
| Authentication | ❌ Fail | Server Error on signin |
| Database Access | ❓ Unknown | Cannot test without working API |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development Team:
1. **Immediate:** Redeploy Convex backend functions
2. **Verify:** Check Convex dashboard for deployment status
3. **Test:** Confirm API endpoints respond correctly
4. **Validate:** Test authentication with known credentials

### For System Admin:
1. Review Convex project deployment configuration
2. Check for any quota limits or access issues
3. Verify production environment variables
4. Monitor deployment logs for errors
