  question: 'A 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to the emergency department with chest pain that started 2 hours ago. The pain is described as crushing, substernal, and radiates to the left arm. ECG shows ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. What is the most likely location of the myocardial infarction?',
  options: [
    'Anterior wall',
    'Posterior wall', 
    'Inferior wall',
    'Lateral wall'
  ],
  correctAnswer: 2,
  explanation: 'ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction. These leads look at the inferior aspect of the heart, which is supplied by the right coronary artery in most patients. The clinical presentation of crushing chest pain with radiation to the left arm is classic for acute MI.',

  options: [
    'Amiodarone',
    'Quinidine',
    'Procainamide',
    'Flecainide'
  ],
  correctAnswer: 2,
  explanation: 'Procainamide has both class Ia (sodium channel blocking) and class III (potassium channel blocking) antiarrhythmic properties. While amiodarone is primarily class III, procainamide\'s dual mechanism makes it unique among antiarrhythmics.',

The patient describes the pain as crushing and substernal with radiation to his left arm and jaw. He reports associated nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. He denies any recent trauma, recent illness, or changes in medications. Vital signs reveal: BP 180/95 mmHg, HR 105 bpm, RR 22/min, O2 sat 92% on room air, temperature 98.6Â°F. Physical examination is notable for diaphoresis, mild respiratory distress, and an S4 gallop on cardiac auscultation. ECG demonstrates ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal changes in leads I and aVL. Cardiac enzymes reveal elevated troponin I. Given this clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, what is the most likely location of the myocardial infarction?'
