# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Setup - Manual Steps Required

## ⚠️ Important Note

The comprehensive CI/CD pipeline has been developed and is ready for deployment, but needs to be added manually due to GitHub App permission restrictions.

## 📁 Files Ready for Manual Addition

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** 
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Location**: Create this file in your repository at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Contents**: The complete workflow file is available locally at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` 

**Note**: This file exists locally but is not tracked by git due to permission restrictions.

### 2. **Lighthouse Configuration**
**File**: `.github/lighthouse/lighthouserc.js` ✅ **Already Added**

This configuration file is already in the repository and ready to use.

## 📋 Manual Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Add the CI Workflow**

1. Create the directory structure: `.github/workflows/`
2. Create the file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
3. Copy the complete workflow content from the local `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file

### **Step 2: Configure Repository Secrets**

Add these secrets in GitHub repository settings:

```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN - Your Netlify authentication token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID - Your Netlify site ID  
```

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**

1. Push any change to trigger the workflow
2. Check the "Actions" tab in GitHub
3. Verify all jobs run successfully

## 🎯 Expected CI Results

Once configured, every push and pull request will automatically:

- ✅ Run 100+ automated tests
- ✅ Verify code quality and TypeScript compliance
- ✅ Test accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Check security vulnerabilities  
- ✅ Measure performance metrics
- ✅ Deploy preview environments
- ✅ Generate comprehensive reports

## 📊 Current Test Coverage

- **102 Total Tests**: Unit, integration, accessibility
- **60+ Component Tests**: Button, Card, Input with full coverage
- **Accessibility Tests**: axe-core integration with WCAG compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse auditing configuration
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and code analysis

## 🔄 Integration Status

This testing infrastructure is fully integrated with:
- ✅ **Storybook Design System** (already merged)
- ✅ **Repository Organization** (Phase 1 complete)
- ✅ **Testing Excellence** (Phase 3 complete)
- 🟡 **CI/CD Pipeline** (ready, needs manual workflow file)
