## üèÜ **Multi-Tier Reliability Testing Strategy**

### **üî¥ Tier 1: Critical Medical Reliability (99.99% Uptime)**

#### **A. Production Health Monitoring (Netlify MCP)**
```bash
# Real-time site status monitoring
netlify sites:info --json
netlify functions:list --json
netlify env:list

# Deploy health checks
netlify deploy:status
netlify build:status
```

**Medical Focus**: Ensure zero downtime during peak study periods (USMLE exam seasons)

#### **B. Database Integrity Testing (Convex + Appwrite MCP)**
```bash
# User data consistency checks
convex run medical:validateUserSessions
appwrite users list --queries='["status.equal(\"active\")"]'

# Quiz data integrity validation
convex run medical:validateQuizQuestions
convex run medical:checkAnswerAccuracy
```

**Medical Focus**: Protect student progress and ensure medical content accuracy

#### **C. Authentication Security (Appwrite MCP)**
```bash
# HIPAA compliance checks
appwrite users sessions list --user-id="test-user"
appwrite account get --jwt="test-jwt"

# Session persistence validation
appwrite account sessions list
```

**Medical Focus**: Secure handling of medical student data and privacy

---

### **üü° Tier 2: Performance & User Experience (TestZeus Hercules)**

#### **A. Load Testing with Medical Student Patterns**
```javascript
// TestZeus Hercules configuration
const medicalLoadTest = {
  scenarios: {
    "peak_study_hours": {
      executor: "ramping-vus",
      startVUs: 50,
      stages: [
        { duration: "5m", target: 200 }, // Simulate evening study rush
        { duration: "10m", target: 500 }, // Peak concurrent users
        { duration: "5m", target: 0 }
      ]
    },
    "quiz_taking_pattern": {
      executor: "per-vu-iterations",
      vus: 100,
      iterations: 10, // Each user takes 10 questions
      maxDuration: "30m"
    }
  }
};
```

**Medical Focus**: Simulate realistic medical student usage patterns

#### **B. Cross-Browser Medical Interface Testing (Playwright MCP)**
```javascript
// Medical student device testing
const medicalDevices = [
  "iPhone 15", // Mobile studying
  "iPad Pro", // Tablet studying  
  "Desktop Chrome", // Library studying
  "Desktop Safari" // Mac users
];

// Accessibility for medical terminology
const medicalAccessibility = {
  standards: ["WCAG21AA", "Section508"],
  medicalTerms: true,
  screenReaderSupport: true
};
```

**Medical Focus**: Ensure accessibility across all medical student study environments

---

### **üü¢ Tier 3: Content & Medical Accuracy**

#### **A. Medical Content Validation**
```bash
# Medical terminology accuracy
testzeus-hercules run medical-content-validation
testzeus-hercules run usmle-question-format-check

# Reference accuracy validation
testzeus-hercules run medical-references-check
```

**Medical Focus**: Verify medical accuracy and USMLE format compliance

#### **B. Quiz Logic Reliability**
```javascript
// Quiz engine stress testing
const quizReliabilityTests = {
  "answer_submission_accuracy": 100, // Must be 100% accurate
  "timer_precision": "¬±50ms", // Medical exam timing precision
  "question_randomization": "statistically_valid",
  "progress_tracking": "real_time_sync"
};
```

**Medical Focus**: Ensure quiz engine reliability for high-stakes medical education
