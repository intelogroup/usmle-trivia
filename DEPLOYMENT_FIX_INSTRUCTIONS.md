## Issue Identified
JavaScript assets were returning 404 errors from production site, preventing React application from loading.

## Root Cause
Asset build/deployment mismatch between local build and Netlify deployment.

## Solution Applied


## Manual Deployment Steps (if needed)

### Option 1: Redeploy Current Build
1. Push current changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve production asset 404 errors"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Netlify Deploy
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### Option 3: Verify Netlify Build Settings
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
2. Verify:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 20
3. Clear build cache and redeploy

## Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Netlify:
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL` = `https://formal-sardine-916.convex.cloud`

## Verification
After deployment, test:
- https://medquiz-pro.netlify.app/register
- Assets should load without 404 errors
- Registration form should be functional
