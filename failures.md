## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Active Warnings (Non-Critical)**

### **1. Development Build Size (Optimization Opportunity)**
**Issue**: Development build is larger than production target  
**Impact**: Low - affects development loading time only  
**Status**: Normal for development builds  
**Priority**: Low  

**Details**:
- Development mode includes source maps and debugging tools
- Production build will be significantly smaller
- No impact on production deployment

**Resolution**: 
- Run `npm run build` for optimized production bundle
- Production deployment automatically optimizes bundle size

---

### **2. Email Verification Disabled (Development Configuration)**
**Issue**: Clerk email verification disabled for development ease  
**Impact**: None in development, requires enabling for production  
**Status**: Intentional development configuration  
**Priority**: Medium (for production deployment)  

**Details**:
- Currently using test credentials: testuser+clerk_test@example.com
- Verification code: 424242 (test mode)
- Production deployment requires enabling email verification in Clerk dashboard

**Resolution**:
```bash
# For production deployment:
# 1. Enable email verification in Clerk dashboard
# 2. Configure production SMTP settings
# 3. Test email verification flow
```
