# üè• MedQuiz Pro - VCT Developer Handoff

## üìã Project Status: VCT Framework Implementation

**Framework**: Visual Code Testing (VCT)  
**Status**: Schema-First ‚úÖ | MCP Integrated ‚úÖ | Visual Testing ‚úÖ  
**Database**: Convex (Primary) + Appwrite (Legacy)  
**Environment**: Production-Ready with comprehensive test coverage  

---

## üéØ VCT Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED VCT Components:
- **Schema Engine**: Full Convex schema with medical entities
- **Screenshot Engine**: 70+ screenshots across environments  
- **MCP Flows**: Playwright, Lighthouse, Convex, Appwrite, Sentry
- **Test Harness**: Comprehensive E2E and unit testing
- **Visual Ingestion**: Cross-device screenshot analysis
- **Artifactory**: Screenshots organized by environment

### üîÑ VCT Components In Progress:
- **Subagent Architecture**: Implementing specialized agents
- **Slash Commands**: `/spec-*` and `/bug-*` workflows
- **Orchestrator**: MCP coordination flows
- **Canonical Docs**: 10 markdown documentation suite

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### **Frontend**: React 19.1 + TypeScript 5.8
- Components: Quiz Engine, Auth System, Dashboard
- State: Zustand with Convex real-time sync
- Testing: 41/41 unit tests passing, comprehensive E2E

### **Backend**: Convex + Appwrite Dual Architecture
- **Convex**: Primary DB with 9 collections (users, questions, quizSessions, etc.)
- **Appwrite**: Legacy auth system (production-ready fallback)
- **MCP Integration**: Full read/write capabilities with authentication

### **Testing Infrastructure**: VCT-Aligned
- **Playwright MCP**: Cross-browser testing with screenshot capture
- **Lighthouse MCP**: Performance auditing across environments
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (100% score)

## üìä Schema Overview (Convex)

### Core Medical Entities:
```typescript
// User medical profiles
users: email, name, points, level, streak, medicalLevel, specialties, studyGoals

// USMLE question bank  
questions: question, options, correctAnswer, explanation, category, difficulty, usmleCategory

// Quiz session tracking
quizSessions: userId, mode, questions, answers, score, timeSpent, status

// Social learning features
leaderboard, bookmarks, friendships, studyGroups, challenges
```

## üîß MCP Server Configuration

### Operational MCP Servers:
- **Convex MCP**: Full CRUD with authentication (`CONVEX_MCP_FULL_ACCESS=true`)
- **Playwright MCP**: Cross-browser testing and screenshots
- **Lighthouse MCP**: Performance auditing (mobile/desktop)
- **Appwrite MCP**: Legacy database operations
- **Sentry MCP**: Error monitoring (ready for production)

---

## üì± User Journey Testing (Verified)

### Authentication Flow:
```
Landing ‚Üí Registration/Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí User Menu ‚Üí Logout
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% tested with real user credentials

### Quiz Taking Flow:
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Mode Selection ‚Üí Quiz Engine ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Retry/Dashboard
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ All modes operational (Quick/Timed/Custom)

### Cross-Device Testing:
- **Mobile**: 375x667 - Perfect responsive design ‚úÖ
- **Tablet**: 768x1024 - Optimal layout adaptation ‚úÖ  
- **Desktop**: 1280x720+ - Full-featured interface ‚úÖ

## üéØ Next VCT Implementation Steps

### 1. Subagent Architecture (High Priority)
- SpecAgent: Feature specification and task generation
- SchemaAgent: Convex schema management and validation
- TestAgent: Automated testing orchestration
- ErrorAgent: Production error analysis
- DocAgent: Canonical documentation maintenance

### 2. Slash Command Integration
```bash
/spec-create <feature> "Description"    # Generate feature specs
/spec-orchestrate <feature>             # Run full VCT pipeline
/bug-create <issue> "Description"       # Create bug analysis
/bug-verify <issue>                     # Validate fix
```

### 3. Visual Baseline Management
- Establish screenshot baselines per environment
- Implement diff analysis for UI regression detection
- Automate visual validation in CI/CD pipeline
