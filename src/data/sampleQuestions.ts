      "Left anterior descending artery (LAD)",
      "Left circumflex artery (LCX)", 
      "Right coronary artery (RCA)",
      "Left main coronary artery"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). The inferior wall of the left ventricle is primarily supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) in most patients. The RCA gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA) which supplies the inferior wall. LAD occlusion would show changes in V1-V6, and LCX occlusion would show changes in I, aVL, V5-V6.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The combination of elevated TSH and low free T4 indicates primary hypothyroidism. In a young woman with symptoms of hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is the most common cause. This autoimmune condition leads to destruction of thyroid tissue and eventual hypothyroidism. Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter cause hyperthyroidism, while subacute thyroiditis typically causes transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This patient has bacterial meningitis based on the CSF findings (low glucose <40 mg/dL, high protein >45 mg/dL, neutrophilic pleocytosis). The gram-positive cocci in pairs suggest Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, given the high prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the recommended empirical therapy for bacterial meningitis in adults is vancomycin PLUS ceftriaxone.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with various pulmonary complications, including interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). The bilateral lower lobe reticular pattern with honeycombing on HRCT is characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, which can occur in RA-ILD. While methotrexate can cause pulmonary toxicity, it typically presents as hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than this chronic fibrotic pattern. The combination of RA history and UIP pattern on imaging makes RA-ILD most likely.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This presentation is classic for infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The combination of fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy (especially posterior cervical), splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytes, and positive monospot test strongly suggests EBV mononucleosis. CMV can cause a similar syndrome but typically has a negative monospot test. The monospot test detects heterophile antibodies that react with EBV infection but not CMV infection.",

      "Prednisone",
      "Azathioprine",
      "Plasmapheresis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "This patient has myasthenia gravis, characterized by fatigable weakness, bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, diplopia), and positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, providing symptomatic relief. While prednisone and azathioprine are used for immunosuppression in myasthenia gravis, and plasmapheresis for acute exacerbations, pyridostigmine is the first-line symptomatic treatment.",

      "HELLP syndrome",
      "Acute fatty liver of pregnancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "HELLP syndrome is a severe variant of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis (elevated LDH), Elevated Liver enzymes (AST >70), and Low Platelets (<100,000). This patient has all three components plus hypertension and proteinuria. The combination of epigastric pain (from liver involvement), thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolysis (elevated LDH) in a pregnant woman with hypertension and proteinuria is diagnostic of HELLP syndrome, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate delivery.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The combination of progressive memory loss, bilateral temporal lobe atrophy on MRI, and CSF findings of elevated tau protein with decreased amyloid-Î²42 is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The temporal lobe atrophy correlates with the memory impairment, and the CSF biomarkers (elevated tau and decreased AÎ²42) are specific for Alzheimer's pathology. Frontotemporal dementia typically shows frontal/temporal atrophy but different CSF findings, while Lewy body dementia has different clinical features and biomarkers.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "This patient has classic signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis: periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, and positive psoas sign. In a young patient with classic presentation, immediate surgical consultation for appendectomy is appropriate. While CT scan can be helpful in unclear cases, the classic presentation warrants urgent surgical evaluation to prevent complications like perforation.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Epidural hematoma with GCS â¤8 indicates severe head trauma with mass effect and impending herniation. Emergency surgical evacuation (craniotomy) is required to prevent brainstem compression and death. The 'lucid interval' followed by rapid deterioration is classic for epidural hematoma.

      "Conservative management with bed rest"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "In elderly patients (>65 years) with displaced femoral neck fractures, hemiarthroplasty is preferred over ORIF due to high rates of nonunion and avascular necrosis with internal fixation. The femoral head blood supply is compromised in displaced fractures. Hemiarthroplasty allows immediate weight bearing and has lower revision rates than ORIF in this population.",

      "Meckel's diverticulum"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The triad of colicky abdominal pain, bloody stool ('currant jelly' stool), and palpable abdominal mass in a toddler is classic for intussusception. The ileocolic type is most common, with the ileum telescoping into the colon. The sausage-shaped mass represents the intussuscepted bowel.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Breast cancer commonly causes osteolytic (lucent/punched-out) metastases that destroy bone without new bone formation, appearing as dark areas on imaging. This is in contrast to osteoblastic metastases (seen with prostate cancer) which appear as sclerotic/white areas due to new bone formation.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This patient has uncomplicated acute appendicitis based on clinical presentation and CT findings. Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred surgical approach for uncomplicated appendicitis in most patients, as it offers advantages including shorter recovery time, less postoperative pain, and better cosmetic results compared to open surgery.",

      "Shigella dysenteriae",
      "Salmonella Typhi",
      "Escherichia coli",
      "Vibrio cholerae"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Salmonella Typhi causes typhoid fever, characterized by prolonged fever, headache, and rose spots on the trunk. The travel history to an endemic area (India) is significant. S. Typhi is gram-negative, catalase positive, and produces H2S (unlike other Salmonella species). The clinical presentation and laboratory characteristics are classic for typhoid fever.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Croup (viral laryngotracheobronchitis) typically affects children 6 months to 6 years old. The classic presentation includes barking cough, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, and low-grade fever. Most cases are caused by parainfluenza virus. Treatment includes cool mist, dexamethasone, and nebulized racemic epinephrine for severe cases.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised patients (especially HIV) can present with numerous lesions on the face and neck. The dome-shaped papules with central umbilication are characteristic. In HIV patients, molluscum can be extensive and persistent. It's caused by a poxvirus and spreads by direct contact or autoinoculation.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This patient has Cushing's syndrome based on clinical features (central obesity, purple striae, buffalo hump, muscle weakness) and elevated 24-hour urine free cortisol. The lack of suppression with dexamethasone suggests either pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) or ectopic ACTH. Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome.",
