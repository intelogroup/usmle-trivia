## üî• Priority 1: Critical Optimizations (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Authentication Performance Fix
**Issue:** 5,387ms login time severely impacts first impression
**Target:** <1,000ms (5x improvement)
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Implement JWT token caching
const cachedToken = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
if (cachedToken && !isTokenExpired(cachedToken)) {
  return authenticateWithToken(cachedToken); // ~50ms
}
```
**Impact:** Medical students get immediate access to study materials
**Effort:** 3-5 days

### 2. Bundle Size Reduction
**Issue:** 599KB bundle exceeds 500KB target
**Target:** <500KB (17% reduction needed)
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Split medical questions by specialty
const MedicalQuestions = lazy(() => import('./questions/by-specialty'));

// Dynamic imports for non-critical features
const AdvancedStats = lazy(() => import('./components/AdvancedStats'));
```
**Impact:** Faster initial load, especially on mobile networks
**Effort:** 5-7 days

---

## üìä Priority 2: Performance Enhancements (2-4 weeks)

### 3. Medical Content Optimization
**Current:** All 105+ questions loaded upfront (107KB)
**Optimized:** Load questions by specialty/difficulty on demand
**Benefits:**
