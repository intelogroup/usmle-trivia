# 🏥 MedQuiz Pro - Strategic Development Guide (2025)

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE CODE AGENTS**

**🤖 If you are a Claude Code agent working on this project, FIRST read the `DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md` file and the `/docs` directory before proceeding with any development tasks.**

**ESSENTIAL READING ORDER:**
1. **`DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md`** - Critical project status, database schemas, environment configuration
2. **`/docs` directory** - Complete design specifications, accessibility standards, analytics requirements

**Commands to read the essential documents:**
```bash
cat DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md
ls /root/repo/docs && find /root/repo/docs -name "*.md" -exec echo "=== {} ===" \; -exec cat {} \;
```

The handoff document provides:
- Complete project status and current implementation
- Database schema and environment variables
- Key components and their functionality
- Deployment instructions and troubleshooting
- Development workflow and maintenance tasks

The `/docs` directory provides:
- Design tokens and responsive design specifications
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Analytics event tracking requirements (8 core events)
- UI states and error handling patterns
- Storybook component library standards
- Comprehensive usability testing plans

**IMPORTANT: Documentation Best Practices**
- **DO NOT CREATE NEW .md FILES** - Instead update existing documentation:
  - `failures.md` - Document any issues or bugs encountered
  - `success.md` - Track completed features and achievements  
  - `DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md` - Update with new implementations
- **Follow /docs specifications religiously** - No feature creep beyond documented requirements
- **Use agile BMAD framework** - Build, Measure, Analyze, Decide with subagents

**After reading both DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md and /docs, you can use this CLAUDE.md file for project vision and strategic guidance.**
