    "uiWeaknesses": [
      "Interface looks dated compared to modern medical apps",
      "Card-based statistics could use more visual appeal",
      "Typography appears basic without modern font choices",
      "Color palette is limited and could be more engaging",
      "Sidebar could use better visual indicators for active states",
      "Overall design lacks the polish of premium medical education platforms"

    "modernizationNeeds": [
      "Implement modern design system (e.g., Tailwind CSS components)",
      "Add glassmorphism or subtle shadows to cards",
      "Upgrade to modern icon set (Lucide, Heroicons)",
      "Implement dark mode support",
      "Add micro-animations and transitions",
      "Modernize color palette with gradients and better contrast",
      "Implement better responsive design patterns"

    "mobileOptimization": [
      "Sidebar should collapse to hamburger menu on mobile",
      "Touch targets need to be larger for mobile interaction",

      "1000ms+ load time indicates optimization opportunities",
