      "Left anterior descending artery (LAD)",
      "Left circumflex artery (LCX)", 
      "Right coronary artery (RCA)",
      "Left main coronary artery"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). The inferior wall of the left ventricle is primarily supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) in most patients. The RCA gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA) which supplies the inferior wall. LAD occlusion would show changes in V1-V6, and LCX occlusion would show changes in I, aVL, V5-V6.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The combination of elevated TSH and low free T4 indicates primary hypothyroidism. In a young woman with symptoms of hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is the most common cause. This autoimmune condition leads to destruction of thyroid tissue and eventual hypothyroidism. Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter cause hyperthyroidism, while subacute thyroiditis typically causes transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This patient has bacterial meningitis based on the CSF findings (low glucose <40 mg/dL, high protein >45 mg/dL, neutrophilic pleocytosis). The gram-positive cocci in pairs suggest Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, given the high prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the recommended empirical therapy for bacterial meningitis in adults is vancomycin PLUS ceftriaxone.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with various pulmonary complications, including interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). The bilateral lower lobe reticular pattern with honeycombing on HRCT is characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, which can occur in RA-ILD. While methotrexate can cause pulmonary toxicity, it typically presents as hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than this chronic fibrotic pattern. The combination of RA history and UIP pattern on imaging makes RA-ILD most likely.",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "This presentation is classic for infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The combination of fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy (especially posterior cervical), splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytes, and positive monospot test strongly suggests EBV mononucleosis. CMV can cause a similar syndrome but typically has a negative monospot test. The monospot test detects heterophile antibodies that react with EBV infection but not CMV infection.",

      "Prednisone",
      "Azathioprine",
      "Plasmapheresis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "This patient has myasthenia gravis, characterized by fatigable weakness, bulbar symptoms (dysphagia, diplopia), and positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, providing symptomatic relief. While prednisone and azathioprine are used for immunosuppression in myasthenia gravis, and plasmapheresis for acute exacerbations, pyridostigmine is the first-line symptomatic treatment.",

      "HELLP syndrome",
      "Acute fatty liver of pregnancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "HELLP syndrome is a severe variant of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis (elevated LDH), Elevated Liver enzymes (AST >70), and Low Platelets (<100,000). This patient has all three components plus hypertension and proteinuria. The combination of epigastric pain (from liver involvement), thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolysis (elevated LDH) in a pregnant woman with hypertension and proteinuria is diagnostic of HELLP syndrome, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate delivery.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "The combination of progressive memory loss, bilateral temporal lobe atrophy on MRI, and CSF findings of elevated tau protein with decreased amyloid-Î²42 is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The temporal lobe atrophy correlates with the memory impairment, and the CSF biomarkers (elevated tau and decreased AÎ²42) are specific for Alzheimer's pathology. Frontotemporal dementia typically shows frontal/temporal atrophy but different CSF findings, while Lewy body dementia has different clinical features and biomarkers.",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "This patient has classic signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis: periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, and positive psoas sign. In a young patient with classic presentation, immediate surgical consultation for appendectomy is appropriate. While CT scan can be helpful in unclear cases, the classic presentation warrants urgent surgical evaluation to prevent complications like perforation.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Epidural hematoma with GCS â¤8 indicates severe head trauma with mass effect and impending herniation. Emergency surgical evacuation (craniotomy) is required to prevent brainstem compression and death. The 'lucid interval' followed by rapid deterioration is classic for epidural hematoma.

      "Conservative management with bed rest"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "In elderly patients (>65 years) with displaced femoral neck fractures, hemiarthroplasty is preferred over ORIF due to high rates of nonunion and avascular necrosis with internal fixation. The femoral head blood supply is compromised in displaced fractures. Hemiarthroplasty allows immediate weight bearing and has lower revision rates than ORIF in this population.",

      "Meckel's diverticulum"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The triad of colicky abdominal pain, bloody stool ('currant jelly' stool), and palpable abdominal mass in a toddler is classic for intussusception. The ileocolic type is most common, with the ileum telescoping into the colon. The sausage-shaped mass represents the intussuscepted bowel.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Breast cancer commonly causes osteolytic (lucent/punched-out) metastases that destroy bone without new bone formation, appearing as dark areas on imaging. This is in contrast to osteoblastic metastases (seen with prostate cancer) which appear as sclerotic/white areas due to new bone formation.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Bell's palsy is idiopathic facial nerve (CN VII) paralysis affecting both upper and lower facial muscles unilaterally. The inability to wrinkle the forehead distinguishes peripheral (Bell's palsy) from central (stroke) facial nerve lesions, where forehead sparing occurs due to bilateral cortical innervation of the upper face.",
