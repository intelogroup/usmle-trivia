### ⚡ **Rapid Form Interactions (Stress Testing)** ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: **PASS** - Site remained stable after rapid interactions

**Test Scenario**: Simulated stressed medical students rapidly clicking during exam pressure:
- **9 interactive elements** identified and tested
- **Rapid clicking sequence** executed with 50ms delays
- **Site stability maintained** after stress testing
- **No crashes or freezes** observed

**Clinical Impact**: Platform remains functional even when students interact rapidly due to exam stress or time pressure.

### 🌐 **Network Interruption Recovery** ⚠️ **PARTIAL**

**Status**: **FAILED** - Technical testing constraints

**Issue**: Network emulation API limitations prevented comprehensive slow network testing
**Observed**: Site loaded successfully under normal conditions
**Recommendation**: Manual testing needed for hospital WiFi scenarios

---

## 📊 **PRIORITY 2 RESULTS: Security & Input Validation**

### 🛡️ **Malicious Input Sanitization** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Status**: **SKIPPED** - No input fields found on homepage for security testing

**Test Scenarios Attempted**:
- XSS injection attempts: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
- JavaScript injection: `javascript:alert("XSS")`
- Image-based XSS: `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>`
- SQL injection: `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
- Iframe injection: `<iframe src="javascript:alert(1)"></iframe>`

**Issue**: Security testing was limited because the homepage doesn't expose input fields directly
**Recommendation**: Security testing should be performed on actual registration/login forms

### 🌍 **Unicode/International Character Support** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Status**: **PASS** - Demonstrated through accented character password testing

**Verified**: French accented characters in password (`Très_Médical_123!`) were properly handled
**Clinical Impact**: International medical students can use native language characters

### 📏 **Extremely Long Input Handling** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Status**: **PASS** - Very long passwords (103+ characters) handled properly

**Test Case**: Password with 100+ repeated characters plus symbols
**Result**: System accepted and processed without errors
**Clinical Impact**: Students who copy-paste long passwords won't encounter issues

---

## 📊 **PRIORITY 3 RESULTS: Performance & Reliability**

### ♿ **Accessibility Compliance** ❌ **FAILED**

**Status**: **FAILED** - Technical testing error

**Issue**: `waitForTimeout` function compatibility error prevented accessibility testing
**Critical Gap**: Accessibility testing is crucial for medical students with disabilities
**Recommendation**: Manual accessibility audit required using tools like axe-core

### 🐌 **Slow Network Performance** ❌ **FAILED**

**Status**: **FAILED** - Network emulation API limitations

**Issue**: Browser API restrictions prevented slow network simulation
**Hospital Context**: This is critical as hospital WiFi is notoriously slow
**Recommendation**: Manual testing with network throttling tools needed

---

## 🔧 **CRITICAL TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. **CSS Selector Compatibility** ⚠️ **MODERATE PRIORITY**

**Issue**: Modern CSS selector syntax not supported in testing environment
```
Error: 'button:has-text("Get Started")' is not a valid selector
```
**Impact**: Automated testing limitations, but doesn't affect user experience
**Solution**: Use more basic CSS selectors for testing

### 2. **Accessibility Testing Gap** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue**: Unable to complete accessibility compliance testing
**Medical Context**: Critical for students with disabilities (ADA compliance)
**Recommendation**: Immediate manual accessibility audit required

### 3. **Security Testing Limitation** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue**: Unable to test input sanitization on actual form fields
**Security Risk**: Unknown XSS/injection vulnerability status
**Recommendation**: Penetration testing on live authentication forms
